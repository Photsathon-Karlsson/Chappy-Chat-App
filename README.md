# Chappy

**Chappy** is a small **Fullstack Chat App** project made for my final school assignment 
(Fullstack, FED23 – Handelsakademin).  
The goal is to show that I can build both **frontend** & **backend**, 
connect them with a **database**, & deploy the app online.

## Concept

Chappy lets users:
- Register and log in  
- See all **users** and **chat channels**  
- Join **open channels**  
- Send messages in channels or by **DM (Direct Message)**  
- Only logged-in users can use **locked channels**

## Technologies Used

**Frontend**
- React + TypeScript  
- CSS   

**Backend**
- Node.js + Express  
- JWT (for login/auth)  
- bcrypt (for password hash)  
- AWS DynamoDB (database)  

**Other**
- REST API connection  
- Deployed online
